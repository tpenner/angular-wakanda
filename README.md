Fell free to test it for some upcoming project but be aware that it is still incomplete and its API potentially subject to change.

## Install

```shell
bower install angular-wakanda
```

Add a `<script>` tags to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/angular-wakanda/angular-wakanda.min.js"></script>
```

Add `wakanda` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['wakanda']);
```

And finally use the `$wakanda` injected service:

```javascript
$wakanda.init().then(function (ds) {

	$scope.contacts = ds.Contact.$find();

});
```
